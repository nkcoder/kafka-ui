# Kafka Management UI - Requirements Specification

## Project Overview

Create a modern, responsive web application for managing and monitoring Apache Kafka clusters with an intuitive interface designed for both developers and operations teams.

## Core Features

### 1. Cluster Management

**Connection & Discovery:**

- Connect to Kafka clusters via bootstrap servers (localhost:9092 for local development)
- Support for multiple cluster profiles/configurations
- Connection status indicator and health checks
- Cluster metadata display (version, controller, etc.)

**Cluster Overview Dashboard:**

- Real-time cluster health metrics
- Broker count and status
- Total topics/partitions summary
- Recent activity feed

### 2. Broker Management

**Information Display:**

- Broker ID, host, port, and rack information
- Broker status (online/offline/leader/follower)
- Resource utilization metrics (disk, memory, network I/O)
- Log directories and disk usage

**Operations:**

- View broker configurations
- Monitor broker performance metrics
- Leader election status
- Partition distribution across brokers

### 3. Topic Management

**Information Display:**

- Topic list with search and filtering capabilities
- Topic details: partitions, replication factor, retention settings
- Partition leader/follower distribution
- Message count and size metrics
- Consumer lag per topic

**Operations:**

- Create new topics with configurable settings
- Update topic configurations (retention, cleanup policy, etc.)
- Delete topics (with confirmation)
- View topic-specific metrics and logs

### 4. Producer Monitoring

**Information Display:**

- Active producers list
- Producer performance metrics (throughput, latency)
- Message production rates by topic
- Error rates and failed sends

**Operations:**

- View producer configurations
- Send test messages to topics
- Monitor producer health and connectivity

### 5. Consumer Management

**Information Display:**

- Consumer groups and their status
- Consumer lag by partition and topic
- Active consumers per group
- Consumption rates and offset tracking

**Operations:**

- View consumer group details and configurations
- Reset consumer offsets
- Monitor consumer rebalancing events
- Consumer group lifecycle management

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend Stack

- **React 19** with modern hooks and concurrent features
- **Next.js 15** with App Router for optimal performance
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience
- **TailwindCSS** for utility-first styling

### UI/UX Requirements

**Design Principles:**

- Clean, modern interface following Material Design or similar guidelines
- Dark/light theme support
- Responsive design (desktop-first, mobile-friendly)
- Consistent color scheme with semantic colors for status indicators

**Key UI Components:**

- Navigation sidebar with collapsible sections
- Dashboard cards with real-time metrics
- Data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination
- Modal dialogs for configuration and operations
- Toast notifications for operation feedback
- Loading states and error boundaries

**Accessibility:**

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

### Performance & Architecture

**Frontend Architecture:**

- Component-based architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Custom hooks for Kafka API interactions
- State management with React Context or Zustand
- Real-time updates using WebSockets or Server-Sent Events

**API Integration:**

- RESTful API client with proper error handling
- Request/response caching where appropriate
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Connection retry logic with exponential backoff

## Development Considerations

### Local Development Setup

- Docker Compose setup for local Kafka cluster
- Environment configuration for different Kafka endpoints
- Hot reload and fast refresh for development
- Proper TypeScript configuration with strict mode

### Code Quality

- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Husky pre-commit hooks
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Type-safe API client generation

### Deployment

- Static export capability for CDN deployment
- Environment-specific configurations
- Docker containerization support

## Future Enhancements (V2)

- Schema Registry integration
- Kafka Connect connector management
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Multi-cluster management
- User authentication and authorization
- Audit logging and compliance features

## Success Criteria

- Intuitive navigation with minimal learning curve
- Real-time data updates without performance degradation
- Reliable connection handling with graceful error recovery
- Comprehensive topic and consumer group management
- Professional appearance suitable for production environments
